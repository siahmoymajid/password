Password generator

- create a password generator that has the length of 8-128

- It needs to have uppercase and lower case as well as include special characters

- it should also have numbers

- a prompt should appear to confim the criteria

- once all the criteria is met, you should see a generated password


Note: I worked with the tutor to explain me the function and assisted me with this assignment.
